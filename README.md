# `libgit2-native-libs`

This is the Racket package `libgit2-native-libs`, a meta-package
distributing the native [libgit2](https://libgit2.org) shared library
via platform-specific dependencies in the Racket package system.

Currently, the pre-built library is provided for the following
platforms:

* `x86_64-linux` (package:
  [`libgit2-x86_64-linux`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/x86_64-linux))

* `aarch64-macosx` (package:
  [`libgit2-aarch64-macosx`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/aarch64-macosx))

* `x86_64-macosx` (package:
  [`libgit2-x86_64-macosx`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/x86_64-macosx))

* `i386-win32` (package:
  [`libgit2-i386-win32`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/i386-win32))

* `x86_64-win32` (package:

## Provenance

These contents of these packages, including this meta-package, were
generated using [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) and a [Nix
flake](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html)
with NAR hash `sha256-dYU0Xn1VXGUrTTn337LJ797RW7rSdz95I5Z1wGYjZwU=`,
last modified on 2022-03-20T00:36:05Z. The flake is from Git commit
[`8d99f34081bcfcd141c74bf6fe967714bf58bce0`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/commit/8d99f34081bcfcd141c74bf6fe967714bf58bce0):
if you are reading this file in a Git repository with the same structure
as
[https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs),
that commit should be part of the
[`build-scripts`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/build-scripts)
branch.

The flake was built by Nix on `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and this
package, libgit2-native-libs, was generated by Guix on `x86_64-linux`.

The included libgit2 shared library is version 1.4.2, built from the
source at
[https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/tree/v1.4.2](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/tree/v1.4.2).
The Nix sha256 hash of the source is
`0xd5w2kzdafipf10sdjmrzzsi12q8rkpcafajwlnmwvrbg6ldvs5`.

The build environment used Nixpkgs from the
[`nixos-21.11`](https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs/tree/nixos-21.11)
branch of
[https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs),
which resolved to commit
[`2c66a7a6e036971c4847cca424125f55b9eb0b0b`](https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs/commit/2c66a7a6e036971c4847cca424125f55b9eb0b0b)
