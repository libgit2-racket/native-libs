# `libgit2-native-libs`

This is the Racket package `libgit2-native-libs`, a meta-package
distributing the native [libgit2](https://libgit2.org) shared library
via platform-specific dependencies in the Racket package system.

Currently, the pre-built library is provided for the following
platforms:

* `x86_64-linux` (package:
  [`libgit2-x86_64-linux`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/x86_64-linux))

* `aarch64-macosx` (package:
  [`libgit2-aarch64-macosx`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/aarch64-macosx))

* `x86_64-macosx` (package:
  [`libgit2-x86_64-macosx`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/x86_64-macosx))

* `i386-win32` (package:
  [`libgit2-i386-win32`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/i386-win32))

* `x86_64-win32` (package:
  [`libgit2-x86_64-win32`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/x86_64-win32))

## Provenance

The contents of these packages, including this meta-package, were
generated using [Guix](https://guix.gnu.org) and a [Nix
flake](https://nixos.org/manual/nix/stable/command-ref/new-cli/nix3-flake.html)
with NAR hash `sha256-ITpLVw5Q7NoDCNcybRn1uDn0cE8Ae/J4XwHBnWbsZ/o=`,
last modified on 2023-07-08T16:47:32Z. The flake is from Git commit
[`0c719ea327f30a1e5e7abc13ddfdd2ad1b065316`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/commit/0c719ea327f30a1e5e7abc13ddfdd2ad1b065316):
if you are reading this file in a Git repository with the same structure
as
[https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs),
that commit should be part of the
[`build-scripts`](https://github.com/LiberalArtist/native-libgit2-pkgs/tree/build-scripts)
branch.

The flake was built by Nix on `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu`, and this
package, `libgit2-native-libs`, was generated by Guix on `x86_64-linux`.

The included libgit2 shared library is version 1.4.3, built from the
source at
[https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/tree/v1.4.3](https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2/tree/v1.4.3).
The Nix sha256 hash of the source is
`02x1a4zrzpzjd0yxnsi8njh5hgihc1iy1v4r0fnl8m4ckcgp6x2s`.

The build environment used Nixpkgs from the
[`nixos-21.11`](https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs/tree/nixos-21.11)
branch of
[https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs),
which resolved to commit
[`06db2e2197401b74fcf82d4e84be15b0b5851c7b`](https://github.com/NixOs/nixpkgs/commit/06db2e2197401b74fcf82d4e84be15b0b5851c7b)
