(when trying to build for iOS):

Unfortunately, we cannot download Xcode.app automatically.
Please go to https://developer.apple.com/services-account/download?path=/Developer_Tools/Xcode_12.3/Xcode_12.3.xip
to download it yourself, and add it to the Nix store by running the following commands.
Note: download (~ 5GB), extraction and storing of Xcode will take a while

open -W Xcode_12.3.xip
rm -rf Xcode_12.3.xip

nix-store --add-fixed --recursive sha256 Xcode.app
rm -rf Xcode.app
