This is the Racket package @tt[pkg-name], a meta-package
distributing the native
@hyperlink["https://libgit2.org"]{libgit2} shared library
via platform-specific dependencies in the Racket package
system.

Currently, the pre-built library is provided for the
following platforms:
@(apply itemlist
        (for/list ([arch+os (in-list (sort platforms arch+os<?))])
          @item{@tt[arch+os] (package: @hyperlink[
 (++ canonical-repo "/tree/" (make-branch-name* arch+os))
 @tt[(make-pkg-name* arch+os)]])}))

If you are reading this file in a Git repository with the
same structure as @url[canonical-repo], you can find the
platform-specific packages on sibling branches of this one.
The @hyperlink[canonical-repo]{@tt{main}} branch may help you
find the relevant branches and commits.
